
Omelete ki likhun yan pasta???
Pasta ki recipie toh aati nahin mujhe
omelete ki hi likhni padegi
ufff.......
(BTW I Don't Like Omelete That Much, still...)
1.) Wash the veggies. 
2.) Add the eggs.
3.) Beat until frothy.
4.) Add oil to a pan and heat it. 
5.) When it is just hot enough, pour the eggs mixture.
6.) Wait until the base firms up, flip it to the other side. 
7.) I prefer to flip the omelette again and cook to make sure it is cooked thru fully.
